<h5>Hygge: the art of simple pleasures</h5>

<p>The Danes are famous for <b><i>being</i></b> one of the world's happiest nations. One possible reason {1:SA:=for} this could be the untranslatable concept of 'hygge'. Hygge has already gained a lot of publicity outside Denmark. This is thanks to a stream of recently published self-help books, {1:SA:=which~=that} all urge us to embrace hygge in order to improve our sense of well-being and happiness.</p>

<p>Writer, Helen Russell, who moved to Denmark several years {1:SA:=ago}, is a hygge enthusiast. She has been fascinated by the idea ever {1:SA:=since} she arrived. Her book, <i>The Year of Living Danishly: Uncovering The Secrets of the World's Happiest Country</i>, makes it easy to understand {1:SA:=why} Helen and her family are still living {1:SA:=there~=there.} . Helen says 'hygge' can be defined {1:SA:=as} 'the absence of anything annoying or emotionally overwhelming'. It's all about being kind to yourself and celebrating the simple things in life, {1:SA:=like} spending time with friends and family, or eating ice cream. So find your inner Dane â€“ and do what makes you happy without feeling guilty about it.</p>
